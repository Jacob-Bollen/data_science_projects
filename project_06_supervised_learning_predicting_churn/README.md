# Predicting Churn
Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.

We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. We have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.

We are required to build a model with the maximum possible F1 score which must be at least 0.59.
